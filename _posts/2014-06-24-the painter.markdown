## Outline

The Painter is the branding project, my client was an independent contractor.
For the development of this brand I have summed up 3 things.

## The process

For the development of this brand I have summed up 3 things.

The concept behind the design of the brand was that just like in the old days, who did you call when you needed to fix something? the plumber, who did you call when you needed to fix your shoes? the shoemaker, Who did you call when you needed to paint your home? THE PAINTER. He’s the expert, he’s your paint dealer, he’ll fix it.

## The Result

My client was really happy with how the brand turned out and the project even got featured in [Branding Served](http://www.brandingserved.com/gallery/17927415/THE-PAINTER), Behance curated section of leading creatives.
